# WebRepo2
This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline to deploy a static index.html webpage on an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy. Whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, the deployment process is automatically triggered and the updated website is deployed on the EC2 server.
